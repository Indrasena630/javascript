        <p class="page 2">In a quiet village nestled between the hills, there lived a curious boy named Oliver. From a young age, he was fascinated by the world around him. Every day, he would venture into the woods, hoping to uncover some hidden treasure or secret path that would lead to an adventure. His parents often warned him to be careful, but Oliver's curiosity always got the better of him.

            One bright morning, Oliver set off early with his trusted satchel, filled with snacks and his favorite book about explorers. He wandered deeper into the forest than he ever had before. The trees were tall, their branches forming a natural canopy that filtered the sunlight. As he walked, he noticed strange markings on the trees, almost as if someone or something had been there before him.
            
            Excited by the possibility of discovering something new, Oliver followed the trail of markings. They led him to a clearing where a large, ancient oak tree stood at the center. At the base of the tree was a peculiar door, small and weathered, barely visible unless you were looking for it.
            
            His heart raced as he approached the door. Who could have built such a thing? Was this the entrance to a hidden world? Without hesitation, Oliver reached for the handle and pulled. The door creaked open, revealing a staircase leading down into darkness.
            
            With a deep breath, he descended into the unknown. The air grew colder as he went deeper. The walls were lined with old stones, and the faint sound of water echoed in the distance. After what felt like an eternity, he reached the bottom.
            
            Before him was a vast underground chamber, illuminated by soft, glowing crystals embedded in the walls. In the center of the room stood a pedestal, upon which rested an ancient book. Oliver approached cautiously, his fingers trembling with anticipation.
            
            As he opened the book, the pages shimmered with strange symbols and text he couldn’t understand. But he knew, deep inside, that this was no ordinary book. It held the knowledge of a time long forgotten, and it was now in his hands.
